# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) Game**! This project is a modern take on the classic game built using **React** and **Vite**. You can play against another player (PvP) or challenge the AI, which uses the Minimax algorithm for strategic gameplay.

## 🚀 Features

- **Player vs Player (PvP)**: Play with a friend locally.
- **Player vs AI**: Challenge a computer opponent using a smart AI that learns and blocks your moves.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make the best possible moves.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive game board for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Confetti Celebration**: Celebrate wins with a confetti animation!
- **Game Reset**: Easily reset the game to start fresh.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast and optimized development and build process.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and Minimax AI algorithm.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for the game.
- **canvas-confetti**: For fun victory animations.
